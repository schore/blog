A twitter message inspired me to write the blog post, in order to share
resources, which I use to keep up in my role as software engineer. This list is
a snapshot.

## Podcast

This are all podcasts I am subscribed to. I don't have time to listen to every
episode, however I like to hear the podcasts, while I am driving or walking.

- [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/) Podcast produced by
  the IEEE
- [Changelog Master](https://changelog.com/master)
- [Testguild](https://testguild.com/podcasts/) The state of the art in test
  automation
- [Technology Pdocast](https://www.thoughtworks.com/podcasts) Podcast from
  ThoughtWorks
- [Code\[ish\]](https://www.heroku.com/podcasts/codeish) Podcast from Heroku
- [{CORECURSIVE}](https://corecursive.com/) Functional programming podcast
- [Software engineering daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)
- [case](https://www.case-podcast.org/) Conversations about software engineering
- [SEI Podcasts](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/podcasts/) Podcast from
  the Carnegie Mellon University about software engineering
- [Software engineering unlocked](https://www.software-engineering-unlocked.com/) Great podcast,
  almost every single podcast is worth to listen to.
- [Tech tiefen](https://techtiefen.de/) *German* Introductions to new
  technologies.
- [Heise Developer](https://www.heise.de/developer/SoftwareArchitekTOUR-4076349.html)
  *German* German podcast about software architecture

## Youtube

Youtube is a great resource for software engineering talks. I listened to a lot
of talks on this platform. Here you can find really inspiring talks on almost
every technical topic. If anyone is interested, I will try to find my favorite
talks.

- [Who Destroyed Three Mile Island? - Nickolas Means](https://youtu.be/1xQeXOz0Ncs)
- [BDD Is Not About Testing - Dan North](https://youtu.be/6nSwRSbc27g)

The great thing is, you will find for almost every topic a conference talk,
which is really a resource to deep dive in a particular context. I watched the
talks while I was ironing.

## Websites

These are some blogs I subscribed with an RSS feed reader.

- [Modernes c++](https://www.grimm-jaud.de/index.php/blog) *German*
- [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com)
- [Clemens Vaster Blog](https://vasters.com/blog)
- [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/)
- [Softwarily](https://softwarily.tumblr.com/rss)

If the blog doesn't have an rss feed it is useless for me. I am not checking
software engineering resources manually.

## Books

Books are also a great resource. Some of them a really inspiring. Here are my
favorites

- The Pragmatic Programmer, David Thomas
- Domain-Driven Design, Eric J. Evans
- The Phoenix Project, Gene Kim

## Twitter

There is also social media, which can help to get to new insights in software
engineering. However this medium also needs a lot of attention, which not always
increase your productivity. Just in case you are interested, you can find them
[here](https://twitter.com/schoreI/following).
