During the pandemic I came across a meme which represents a set of covid 19
survival probabilities. Grouped in sets, so the numbers look really great. The
human mind doesn't understand probabilities well, so I found a nice way to
visualize it.

So let me explain the application and what it shows. The table below shows an
example. In case everybody catches the virus the probability, that somebody will
die is shown, as in the application above.

Here is an example.

| **People included**    | **Probabilities of at least one death** |
| Oneself                | 0.03 %                                  |
| Partner and kids       | 0.07 %                                  |
| Parents                | 5.19 %                                  |
| Brothers & sisters     | 5.30 %                                  |
| Aunts and uncles       | 18.11 %                                 |
| Friends and colleagues | 22.46 %                                 |

The probabilities are getting really awful in just a small number of steps, so
everyone should be careful about the ongoing pandemic. It is way more dangerous,
than the death rates look at the first glance. And as **society** we decided to
contain the pandemic to protect our loved family and friends.

- Stay at home
- Wear masks
- Wash your hands

## Application internals

### Data

The data used for the application are official death and survival rates from
Bavarian (Germany).

## Application

The application is written in clojurescript and can be found on
[github](https://github.com/schore/covid19-deathrates). Feel free to review and
improve this small application.

## Math

I am not a math major or came across probability theory during my career. So
this is the math I used for the calculation.

```clojure
(defn prob-or
  ([x] x)
  ([x & t] (- 1.0 (* (- 1.0 x)
                     (- 1.0 (apply prob-or t))))))
                     
(defn prob-pow [x n]
  (- 1.0 (Math/pow (- 1.0 x) n)))
```

I don't expect an error in this equations so the calculations should be
accurate.
